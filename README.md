# weatherdashboard

#### Create a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
#### Use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. The app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
#### When I view the weather dashboard, I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
#### When I view future weather conditions for that city, I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
#### When I click on a city in the search history, I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
